## Changes and Additions

My fork focuses on code cleanup and on using newer features (like hooks) which weren't used in the book. These additions are a byproduct of my learning process, I'm adding them here in case they might be useful to someone out there.

I'm using `yarn`, but you can also use `npm` instead.

In `todo-hooks`, I'm refactoring the app using function based components with hooks.
